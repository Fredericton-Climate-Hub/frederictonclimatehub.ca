Our events are open to anyone wishing to learn about climate change and what they can do in their lives to help reduce their impact and adapt to the impending effects of climate breakdown. Emphasis is on resilience and becoming increasingly self-sufficient while cultivating relationships within the community. Those people most resilient to climate shocks (floods, power-outages, fires, etc.) will be those with pre-existing relationships and networks in their areas.

Hub supporters/volunteers meet monthly to plan activities and review the science and progress being made all around us. You don't need any expertise to attend; the welcome mat is out!
