title: The Hub

The Fredericton Community Climate Hub grew out of public meetings convened in Fredericton in late 2023. We are part of the [Climate Reality Project Canada's](https://www.climatereality.ca/) national network of [Climate Hubs](https://www.climatehub.ca/). We became an incorporated Non-Profit organization in March 2024.

## Our Goals
We strives to empower and mobilize Frederictonians in individual and collective efforts to address climate change, and to make our city more resilient, adaptive, self-sufficient and sustainable. We seek to create awareness, build a climate-aware community of care, partnering with like-minded organizations and demonstrating what practical actions can be taken with a liveable climate in mind.

## Our Values
- __***Effectiveness***__: We seek actions that achieve real climate benefits, not just maximize efficiency.
- __***Empowerment***__: Given the right knowledge and tools, everyone can become part of the change we are advocating for.
- __***Diversity***__: A broad and diverse range of Frederictonians and organizations need to be engaged on the climate crisis to develop impactful solutions.
- __***Independent***__: We focus on climate action and policies unaffected by political parties, politicians, or government entities.
