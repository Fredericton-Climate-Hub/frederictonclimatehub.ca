In 2024-25 the Climate Hub will focus on solid waste, by studying all (public and private) systems designed to divert, handle and usefully repurpose Fredericton’s cast-offs.

Thanks to a grant from the City of Fredericton and Mitacs, we have an intern working to document and spread the word on the different opportunities residents have to divert post-consumer waste products and organics. 

A waste audit performed by the City in November 2024 showed that 60% of what people put into the trash is ‘divertible’ ie., it can be redeemed for cash, sent to recycling, composted at home or donated to charity. A large component of this undiverted waste is organics, ie., food waste which could be converted into useful compost for the garden.

Read the CBC article on the waste audit findings dated January 24, 2025 where Hub Director Patrick Schilf speaks on behalf of the Fredericton Climate Hub.
